            <p>Melissa Derricott started web development as a hobby in high school after taking an introductory HTML class.  Knowing a few small business owners Melissa saw this as an opportunity to earn some money, instead of going the traiditonal route of flipping burgers.  Though she very much enjoyed building web pages this never understood it could be a profession, so instead of pursing web development as a career, always an artistic kid, Melissa decided to study Fine Arts in college.  </p>

            <p>After graduating college with an Interior Deign Degree, Melissa went on to work in the architecture field, starting as an architectural intern, she worked her way up to a Job captain. A large part of her role at the firm was to work in Autocad drawing from the sketches of architects. The work with the firm was very rewarding and challenging.  A strong attention to detail and work ethic was established during that time and has carried on.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Melissa rededicated herself to web development enrolling in a Full Stack program at Univeristy of Richmond. You can find some projects on the profolio page.</p>
